Recently, At the AWS Generative AI Hackathon 2024, our `Course5 AI Labs` team secured 1st runner up üèÜ  for our prototype, AdevertGen.ai which is an AI-powered platform that allows the sellers to automatically generate stunning product ads in the form of lifestyle background images, content, and slideshow videos. Overall, AdvertGen.ai enables the creation of dynamic ads through:

- **Lifestyle Background Images**: Utilizing Amazon Bedrock service Titan Image Generation model to regenerate product image backgrounds, enhancing visual appeal.

- **Content Generation**: Crafting product titles and descriptions automatically for enhanced marketing impact, ensuring compelling content.

- **Video Slideshow**: Generating engaging slideshows of regenerated images paired with audio description using Amazon Polly's text-to-speech feature, enhancing ad interactivity.

About 75% of sellers find it challenging to create engaging ads and formats due to plain content, leading to fewer clicks from potential buyers. Our solution offers both content generation and online advertising in one convenient platform.

Also, platforms like this can really help sellers especially small sellers to create ads quickly with minimal to no manual intervention which can increase the click-through rate resulting in revenue growth
