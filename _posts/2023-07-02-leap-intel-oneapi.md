Recently, At the Intel® oneAPI Hackathon 2023, our team `C5ailabs` lead by me secured 1st prize 🏆  for our prototype, LEAP (Learning Enhancement and Assistance Platform) which is an AI-powered platform that enhances student learning outcomes and promotes equitable access to quality education. LEAP offers two key components:

❑ Ask Question/Doubt: Students can ask real-time questions about provided materials, receiving answers with specific timestamps in related videos, eliminating the need to scroll through. Multilingual support ensures no language barriers hinder learning.

❑ Interactive Conversational AI Examiner: After each learning session, an AI examiner evaluates students' knowledge through a viva, motivating and providing hints for correct answers, fostering engagement and motivation.

**Also, 😊 Thanks to the Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics toolkit, we enhanced our solution by 4.44x in terms of inference speed on the 4th Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors (Sapphire Rapids).** For our Ask Question/Doubt component we have provided several benchmarks comparing Pytorch Base model vs Intel® Extension for Pytorch (IPEX), 
Intel® Neural Compressor and comparing Scikit-Learn Base model vs Intel® Extension for Scikit-Learn.
