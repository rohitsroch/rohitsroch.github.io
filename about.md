Hi there, Welcome to my personal tech [Blog](https://rohitsroch.github.io/#latest-posts)!

I'm Rohit Sroch currently working as a Sr. AI Scientist at [Course5 - AI Labs](https://www.course5i.com/ai-labs/) and formerly worked as Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [Quantiphi](https://www.quantiphi.com/). My interest mainly lies in building AI systems for NLU/NLG and the Speech domain. I firmly believe in making AI accessible and useful to everyone.

I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee in 2017 under the discipline of Metallurgical & Materials Engineering. During my undergraduate days, I got my interest in the field of Computer Science and decided to pursue this as my career path. Due to my rigorous hard work, I landed a summer internship as a Software Developer at [Practo](https://www.practo.com/). After graduation, I worked as a Software Developer for a few months and finally decided to move into the Data science field. Since then, I have learned a lot and involved in ideating/building solution architecture for some of the most difficult problem statements. Also, I always like to approach any problem with a research mindset.   

In my spare time, I like to read books, listen to music with profound lyrics that deeply move me, watch sci-fi/comedy movies, and love discussing space theories.
