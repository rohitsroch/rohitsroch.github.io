Hi there, Welcome to my personal English tech [Blog](https://rohitsroch.github.io/#latest-posts) !

I'm Rohit Sroch currently working as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [Quantiphi](https://www.quantiphi.com/). My interest mainly lies in building AI systems for NLU/NLP and Speech domain. I firmly believe in making AI accessible and useful to everyone.

I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee in 2017 under the discipline of Metallurgical & Materials Engineering. During my undergraduate days, I got my interest in field of Computer Science and decided to persue this as my career path. Due to my rigorous hardwork, I landed a summer internship as a Software Developer at [Practo](https://www.practo.com/). After graduation, I worked as a Software Developer for few months and finally decided to move in field of data science. Since then, I have learnt alot and involved in ideating/building solution architecture for some of the most difficult problem statements. Also, I always like to approach any problem with a research mindset.   

In my spare time, I like to watch sci-fi/comedy movies and love to discuss about space theories.
