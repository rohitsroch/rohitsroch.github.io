Hi there, Welcome to my personal tech [Blog](https://rohitsroch.github.io/#latest-posts)!

I'm Rohit Sroch currently working as an AI Engineer at **Google** <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/icons/google-logo.png" alt="Google Logo" style="width:25px; height:25px;"> formerly worked as a Sr. AI Scientist at [C5i - AI Labs](https://www.c5i.ai/ai-labs/) <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/icons/c5i-logo.png" alt="C5i Logo" style="width:70px; height:35px;"> and worked as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [Quantiphi](https://www.quantiphi.com/) <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/icons/quantiphi-logo.png" alt="Quantiphi Logo" style="width:33px; height:33px;">. My interest mainly lies in building AI systems for NLU/NLG and the Speech domain. I firmly believe in making AI accessible and useful to everyone.

I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee in 2017 under the discipline of Metallurgical & Materials Engineering. During my undergraduate days, I got my interest in the field of Computer Science and decided to pursue this as my career path. Due to my rigorous hard work, I landed a summer internship as a Software Developer at [Practo](https://www.practo.com/) <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/icons/practo-logo.png" alt="Practo Logo" style="width:25px; height:25px;">. After graduation, I worked as a Software Developer for a few months and finally decided to move into the Data science field. Since then, I have learned a lot and involved in ideating/building solution architecture for some of the most difficult problem statements. Also, I always like to approach any problem with a research mindset.   

In my spare time, I like to read books, listen to music with profound lyrics that deeply move me, watch sci-fi/comedy movies, and love discussing space theories.
